Project 3 for Data Structures

This application pulls from a data set of 700,000 restaurants in the US and returns only non-chain restaurants in your area based on either latitude/longitude or state/country. This was implemented using both a hashmap and hashset, and the runtimes can be displayed in the program as well to compare performance.

Download the files and run ./app in Terminal to use the application.
